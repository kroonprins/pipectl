- context / config commands
- create command to create a build/release/... ?
- describe command
- edit command

- in variable groups and agent pools for release pipelines it should be possible to also define them with 'id:' or 'name:' to handle the case where the name is a number
- register stuff via annotations? (e.g. via tsyringe)
- remove some duplication in azure devops reporters, transformers, etc
- yargs: no error when no command matches
- extra checks on delete to make sure not to delete something that is still referenced somewhere? (e.g. variable group reference by a pipeline)
- syntax for tasks in release definition is different as for build definition / task group => allow the other (better) syntax for release definitions
- github actions and tests
- order needed in delete?
