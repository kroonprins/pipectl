* diff
* no api call if no diff
* support
  * --selector / -l (basic implementation done)
  * --timeout
  * --validate
* transformations:
  * variable groups by name
  * task group by name
* check tags. If we can add tags from the labels, then the --selector could also work on "get"
* allow project by name in BuildDefinition/ReleaseDefinition
