- diff (+no api call if no diff)
- support
  - --timeout
  - --validate
- transformations:
  - task group by name
  - subscription by name
  - approver by name
- handle -f option on get
- handle remote file for -f
- clear error message when definition file can't be parsed if file has no extension (stdin)
- tags creation does not seem to work. If they would work the selector for "get" could be implemented
- context / config commands
- create command to create a build/release/... ?
- describe command
- edit command
- logs command
- in variable groups and agent pools for release pipelines it should be possible to also define them with 'id:' or 'name:' to handle the case where the name is a number

- register stuff via annotations? (e.g. via tsyringe)
- remove some duplication in azure devops reporters, transformers, etc
- check if yarn workspaces can be alternative for lerna
- yargs: no error when no command matches
- extra checks on delete to make sure not to delete something that is still referenced somewhere? (e.g. variable group reference by a pipeline)
- apply enumValue function for defaults/exports also for other resource types
